Handwittern digit Recognition Project
=======
This is my B.Sc. project. It is done under supervision of Prof. Mehdi Dehghan Takhtfooladi. In order to run it on a non-Android devices, you shoud first install an Android emulator such as BlueStacks.
You can download BlueStacks via this link: https://p30download.com/fa/entry/39166/ 

After installing BlueStacks, you should install the Apk file provided in this repository. Then you can run the App by simply open the BlueStacks
and click on the App icon. 

two points worth mentioning are:

1- Please do not evaluate the performance of application simply by a few requests you made to it. The Neural Network used in this program,
employs user's feedback for Online learning. So you need to use it to some extent so that the Neural Net gets more training data and make a 
better prediction. 

2- You can use the touch mode easily by opening the App and selecting the touch mode. However, in order to use Camera mode and Image mode, at first you need to
install OpenCV package .
