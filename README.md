Handwittern digit Recognition Project
=======
This is my undergraduate project. In order to run it on a non-Android device, you shoud first install an Android emulator such as BlueStacks.
You can download BlueStacks via this link: https://p30download.com/fa/entry/39166/ 

After installing BlueStacks, you should install the Apk file provided in this repository. Then you can run the App simply by openning the BlueStacks
and clicking on the App icon. 

two points worth mentioning are:

1- Please do not evaluate the performance of application based on a few requests you made to it. The Neural Network used in this program,
employs user's feedback for Online learning. So you need to use it to some extent so that the Neural Net gets more training data and make a 
better prediction. 

2- You can use the touch mode easily by opening the App and selecting the touch mode. However, in order to use Camera mode and Image mode, at first you need to
install OpenCV package.
